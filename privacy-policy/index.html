    our highest priorities. We do not record, store, collect any personal information(information that identifies you as
    an individual). We do not attempt to obtain any sensitive information. However, we may keep a copy of your email ID
    if you contact us directly.

    consent. However, information will be disclosed where required by law. We do not knowingly solicit data from or
    market to children under the age of 13.

  <p>Although we do not attempt to track your information, our products may contain third parties’ API’s. We collect
    only anonymous data(non-personal information) such as game-play stats, app usage stats, scores, achievements, time
    spent, feature usage which is used to analyze and improve our products in order to provide you with an efficient
    user experience. This privacy policy does not apply to information that may be collected by any third party, so we
    are therefore not responsible for that information.
  </p>
  <p>By downloading and installing the apps on your mobile device, using the apps, you agree to the terms and conditions
    set forth in this privacy policy.

  <p>We do not collect any information from anyone under 13 years of age. Our website, products and services are all

  <p><strong>Important – Note to users</strong></p>
  <p>Never download our apps from anywhere except Google Play(<a
      href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Aaradhya+Apps">Link</a>). Exceptions are sites like Apkpure,
    and a few other sites etc., which provide the original(&#8220;non-modified&#8221;) app from Google Play.
  </p>
  <p>All our apps are available officially only on Google Play and don’t rely on third party sites providing modded
    apk’s or free pro versions. They may contain malicious code that may compromise your personal data/files. We aren’t
    responsible for any issues caused through the use of modded versions.</p>
  <p>If you have downloaded our apps from such sites offering modded apk&#8217;s we request you to uninstall it at the
    earliest and download the latest, safe and secure versions from Google Play(<a
      href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Aaradhya+Apps">Link)</a>.</p>
  <p>At Aaradhya Apps we never collect any personal data from users and user privacy is one of our highest priorities
    but third party apk sites providing free modded apks may have code injected to them that may read your personal
    data. So on basis of the values and concern we hold towards users safety and privacy we strictly advise against
    downloading from such sites.</p>
  <p>This privacy policy applies to all our apps only when you download from ‘Google Play’.</p>
